# Amathm Portfolio Single Page Application (SPA) 

An Implementation of my new portfolio, using latest angular stable version (8) and NodeJs.
It will be developed in stages, in order to save me some time, but I want to deploy
A simple version, in order to have something public, even if its work in progress.

## Install 
Run `npm install` in order to create node_module - install dependencies from package.json

## Run app

Run `npm start` to launch application and open it in localhost sever. It will navigate you to `http://localhost:4200/` - presuming port `4200` is available. 

## Running unit tests

Test to be implemented.

May stick with karam and jasmine :)
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
