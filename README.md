## Amathm Portfolio Single Page Application (SPA) 

An Implementation of my new portfolio, using latest angular stable version (8) and NodeJs.
It will be developed in stages, in order to save me some time, but I want to deploy
A simpple version, in order to have something public, even if its work in progress.

# Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

# Running unit tests

May end up using jest unit testing framework, if I do implement it.
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
